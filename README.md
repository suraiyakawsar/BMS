**About:**
A Laravel PHP CRUD project that I have built using TailwindCSS, took almost 30 hours to code over a period of 7 days.
**Complications faced:** Database integration. **Time wasted:** Total 1 Day.

Process & Challenges faced:
1) Completed a crash course of 6 hours.
2) Downloaded ***several*** apps and extensions.
3) Searched various platforms to follow up with the database integration. Had issues with MySQL, migration and table creation, but instant relief felt once it worked.
4) Decided to use TailwindCSS instead of Bootstrap because versatile. But will convert it to Bootstrap eventually, just like that, to learn.
5) Pushed to Github. Ta-da!

**Total Project Time:**
